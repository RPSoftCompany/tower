# What is "configuration server"

A "configuration server" is a centralized system or platform designed to manage and distribute configuration settings and parameters across various applications, services, or systems within an organization's infrastructure. It serves as a repository for storing configuration data and provides mechanisms for retrieving and updating this data as needed. Configuration servers help ensure consistency, manageability, and security of configurations across distributed environments, making it easier to deploy, maintain, and scale applications and services.
