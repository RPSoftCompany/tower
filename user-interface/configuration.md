# Configuration

### Overview

In Tower, a configuration refers to a collection of key/value variables organized within a defined hierarchical structure. For instance, if we'd refer to our [example](../how-to-start/example.md), you can craft a configuration for the "App1" application within the "Development" environment and under the "A" technology, constituting one configuration instance. Similarly, creating a comparable configuration for "App2" application within the same technology and environment would represent another configuration instance.

At the same time, every configuration instance retains a record of all modifications applied to it. This allows users to review or revert to any previous configuration instance whenever necessary.

Another advantage of employing a hierarchical structure is the ability to store configuration components across different tree levels. This facilitates the sharing of configuration variables among various applications.

### How to create your first configuration?

Creating a configuration instance in Tower is straightforward. Simply navigate to your desired configuration path (as demonstrated in the video above) and add the necessary configuration variables. Then, click the "Save configuration" button, and your configuration is securely stored.
