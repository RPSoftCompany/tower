# First steps

Upon starting Tower for the first time, setting the admin password is the initial step. After launching Tower and accessing the main screen, you'll encounter a prompt for a username and password. Enter "admin" for both the username and password fields to proceed. This action will redirect you to the change password page, where you can securely set the admin password to a personalized and secure value.

The subsequent step involves configuring the Base Models within Tower. To do this, please refer to the guidelines outlined in the "[How to create a new Base Model](../user-interface/settings/configuration-settings/base-models.md#how-to-create-a-new-base-model)" section. This will provide you with the necessary steps and procedures to effectively set up and configure the Bases within Tower according to your specific requirements.

After that just set up the [Bases](../user-interface/model.md) and you're ready to create your first configuration.
