To illustrate how Tower operates, let's consider an example scenario:

Imagine your organization utilizes three distinct technologies: A, B, and C. Each technology encompasses three environments—Development (Dev), Testing (Test), and Production (Prod)—and within each environment, there are various instances or applications specific to that technology.

From a configuration standpoint, this setup yields three distinct hierarchical structures, one for each technology. Each structure consists of three levels: the technology itself, its associated environments, and the applications within those environments.

To establish this structure within Tower, we begin by crafting the Base Configuration. This foundational framework delineates the hierarchical relationships, requiring the creation of three objects: Technology, Environment, and Application.

Once the structure is defined, it's time to populate it with relevant content. This involves adding entries for each technology (A, B, and C), followed by the inclusion of the three environment entries (Dev, Test, Prod). Finally, all pertinent applications are incorporated into their respective environments.

With this setup complete, Tower stands prepared for use, empowering you to commence configuring applications seamlessly within the established hierarchical framework.
