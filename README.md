# Introduction

Tower is a feature rich and customizable configuration server. It was made, to make configuration management easy but at the same time secure.

The biggest advantage of Tower is its flexibility. Other configuration servers force applications to use its own way of thinking, that's not the case in Tower. It's you \(as a developer\), who chooses how your configuration will look like, so you don't need to change your application to fit configuration server. Tower can serve configuration in any maner you like.
