Tower is a feature rich and customizable configuration server. It was made, to make configuration management easy but at the same time secure.

The biggest advantage of Tower is its flexibility. Other configuration servers force applications to use its own way of thinking, that's not the case in Tower. It's you \(as a developer\), who chooses how your configuration will look like, so you don't need to change your application to fit configuration server. Tower can serve configuration in any maner you like.

But, of course, that's not the only feature you can find in Tower. This tools enables you to create custom rules to validate your configuration, promote configuration, set default values or even force it. Advanced permission functionality gives you full flexibility of assigning different roles to different users in your organization. And yes, you can connect your LDAP to Tower.

But enought of this, let us show you how to install and start Tower.
