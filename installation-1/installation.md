# Installation

### Prerequisites

Tower uses MongoDB database, as a storage. So you will need such database and a user, that has privileges to create collections in given database.

### Installation

First of all, you will need to download Tower. To do so, go to [https://github.com/RPSoftCompany/tower/releases](https://github.com/RPSoftCompany/tower/releases) and choose the latest version of Tower.zip file.  
After the download, unzip the archive.  
And that is all. You don't need to install it. Tower is a completely standalone product.
