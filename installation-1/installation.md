# Installation

### Prerequisites

* MongoDB (version 5.0 or above) instance with user allowed to create and modify one database
* Docker (for docker installation)
* NPM (for standalone installation)

### Installation

#### Docker

Tower is aimed to be released as a cloud native project, that's why the only prebuilt product can be found as a docker image. In case you'd like to build it on your own, please visit the [standalone installation](installation.md#standalone) section.



#### Standalone



First of all, you will need to download Tower. To do so, go to [https://github.com/RPSoftCompany/tower/releases](https://github.com/RPSoftCompany/tower/releases) and choose the latest version of Tower.zip file.\
After the download, unzip the archive.\
And that is all. You don't need to install it. Tower is a completely standalone product.

Of course you will need to configure it, but you can find details related to it in [configuration](configuration.md) page.
